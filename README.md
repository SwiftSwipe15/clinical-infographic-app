Clinical Infographic & Audit AppThis application is an AI-powered thought partner designed to convert complex, multi-specialist Word reports into patient-friendly infographic summaries. It specifically audits reports for clinical compliance based on the 13 diagnostic categories and age-specific mandatory assessments.🌟 Key Features13-Category Classification: Automatically maps diagnoses (e.g., Mood, Neurodevelopmental, Movement Disorders) to a standardized clinical framework.Mandatory Assessment Audit: Cross-references the report text against mandatory baseline tests for Adults, Children, and Elders.4-Pillar RAG Analysis: Visualizes client health across four domains: Mind, Memory, Mobility, and Lifestyle using a Red-Amber-Green (RAG) system.Spider Graph Visualization: Provides an at-a-glance view of clinical balance and symmetry.Automated PDF Export: Generates a professional multi-page report for clients, including authored specialist recommendations.🛠️ Setup Instructions1. Local EnvironmentIf you want to run this on your own computer:Install Python (3.9 or higher).Install dependencies:Bashpip install streamlit openai python-docx plotly pandas fpdf2
Run the app:Bashstreamlit run clinical_app.py
2. Live Deployment (Streamlit Cloud)Upload clinical_app.py and requirements.txt to a GitHub repository.Connect your GitHub to Streamlit Share.Deploy the app.🧪 How the Clinical Audit WorksThe app uses a "Mandatory vs. Optional" logic gate derived from your clinical guidelines:Age GroupDiagnosis CategoryMandatory Assessments (Examples)AdultCategory 1 (Mood)MSE, WHO QOL, HAM A/D, Rorschach, Y-BOCSChildCategory 4 (Neurodev)VSMR, AAMR, BKT, Vanderbilt, CARSElderCategory 6 (Neurocog)MSE, ACE, HAM A/D, EASI, GDS, CDRNote: Items like NPI (Neuropsychiatric Inventory) and Physician Recommendations are treated as optional/supplementary data and do not trigger audit failures if absent.🔒 Security & PrivacyNo Data Retention: This app is designed to process data in-memory. If deployed correctly, no patient data is stored on the server.API Security: Never hardcode your OpenAI API Key. Use Streamlit’s "Secrets" manager or the sidebar input to keep your credentials safe.🛠️ Customization (Rectification)Update Standards: To add a new mandatory test, edit the MANDATORY_STANDARDS dictionary in clinical_app.py.Alias Support: If the app fails to recognize a test abbreviation, add it to the aliases list for that assessment in the code.
